Day 14:
 - Rapid: derive 'floating-bit' combinations using a recursive function &
   simple string building 

Day 17 part 2 - different angles:
 - Slow (260 ms) What sort of speed-up could be expected from symmetry?
 - Future utils:
     - handling >= 4D data
     - Combinatoric iterators (like python itertools)

Day 19 (parsing) - oh, so many ideas...
 - Learn: browse other interesting solutions
 - Perf: stop with all the array copying
 - Shortest: convert rule-text to an ANTLR grammar, generate a parser (or just tokenizer?)
 - Competitive: develop a reusable rule engine
 - Language: try one that makes the head|tail stuff more natural
