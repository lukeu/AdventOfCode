# AdventOfCode_2020
My first attempts at speed-coding, and first time in AoC 

Getting up at 5:40am each day, I'm pretty groggy to start off with.
Still, I'm having a crack at coding fast, not clean, and then learning
what I should be doing to get faster (which is often cleaner too, but
that's never the priority).

I'm sticking with Java this year (as I have too much else going on to
afford time learning). I have used https://projecteuler.net/ in the past
to practice less-familiar languages. (E.g. python seems particularly
well-suited.) Maybe in a future AoC I'll do that instead.
